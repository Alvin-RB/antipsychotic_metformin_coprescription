Farache Trajano L, Hayes JF, Launders N, Davies NM, Osborn DPJ, Richards-Belle A. (2024). Co-prescription of Metformin and Antipsychotics in Severe Mental Illness: A UK Primary Care Cohort Study.

This study evaluates the incidence, prevalence, and demographic patterns of metformin co-prescription among patients diagnosed with SMI initiating SGA therapy and estimates the impact of co-prescription on weight over time. The data source is [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)](https://www.cprd.com/). To support transparency and open science, this repository hosts code and materials which support the manuscript - including:

#### R Scripts

Code was developed Dr Luiza Farache Trajano and reviewed by Alvin Richards-Belle.

1. Group derivation and survival analysis
2. Demographics of patients prescribed SGAs only versus SGA+metformin
3. Demographics of patients SGA+metformin with a recorded potential indication versus no recorded indication
4. Descriptive analysis of weight over time
5. Estimate the effect of metformin co-prescription accounting for confounders
6. Annual period prevalence rates
